# Quick Fix for Dashboard Display Issue

The dashboard is showing raw code instead of rendering. This usually means there's a JavaScript syntax error.

## Immediate Fix:

1. **Restore the backup**:
```bash
copy index_backup_20250117.html index.html
```

2. **Test locally first**:
Open index.html in your browser locally to make sure it works

3. **If the backup works, carefully add the filter feature**:
We'll need to add the data contract filter more carefully, testing each step

4. **Alternative - Use the test file**:
```bash
copy test-index.html index.html
```

## Or push the working version directly:
```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "fix: restore working dashboard"
git push origin main
```

The issue is likely in the JavaScript code where we check for data contract labels. There might be a missing quote or bracket.
