# Working Protocols & Development Standards

## 🎯 CORE WORKING PRINCIPLES

### 1. **Execution Priority**
```
Priority 1: Direct file system operations (whenever possible)
Priority 2: PyCharm terminal commands
Priority 3: Manual operations with detailed documentation
```

### 2. **Development Environment**
- **IDE**: PyCharm (preferred environment)
- **Terminal**: PyCharm integrated terminal
- **Local Repo**: `C:\Users\FElmasri\Desktop\github-pr-analytics`
- **Remote Repo**: `https://github.com/aviv-fathallahelmasri/pr-analytics-dashboard`

### 3. **Best Practices Framework**
- **Code Quality**: PEP 8, type hints, comprehensive docstrings
- **Documentation**: Every aspect documented with rationale
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end validation
- **Security**: Token management and minimal permissions
- **Performance**: Monitor and optimize continuously

## 📋 STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

### File Operations Protocol
```
1. Check file existence and permissions
2. Execute operation via filesystem tools
3. Verify operation success
4. Document changes with timestamp
5. Test affected functionality
6. Update relevant documentation
```

### PyCharm Terminal Commands
```bash
# Environment activation
venv\Scripts\activate

# Dependency management
pip install -r config\requirements.txt
pip freeze > config\requirements.txt

# Core operations
python src\fetch_pr_data.py
python src\serve_dashboard.py
python src\update_and_deploy.py

# Git operations
git status
git add .
git commit -m "type: description with comprehensive details"
git push origin main
```

### Documentation Standards
```markdown
## Documentation Template
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
**Type**: [FEATURE|BUGFIX|ENHANCEMENT|REFACTOR]
**Component**: [DATA_COLLECTION|DASHBOARD|AUTOMATION|DEPLOYMENT]
**Description**: Detailed description of changes
**Rationale**: Why this change was made
**Impact**: What this change affects
**Testing**: How the change was validated
**Performance**: Any performance implications
**Dependencies**: What this change depends on
**Risks**: Potential issues or concerns
```

## 🔧 EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Before Every Task
1. **Verify Environment**: Check PyCharm project is loaded correctly
2. **Activate Virtual Environment**: Ensure venv is active
3. **Check Repository Status**: Verify we're on correct branch
4. **Review Current State**: Understand what we're working with

### During Execution
1. **Use Direct Operations**: Prefer filesystem tools over commands
2. **Verify Each Step**: Check results immediately
3. **Document Everything**: Record all actions and decisions
4. **Test Continuously**: Validate functionality at each step

### After Completion
1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Verify all functionality works
2. **Update Documentation**: Record all changes and rationale
3. **Commit Changes**: Push to remote repository
4. **Monitor Results**: Check for any issues or improvements

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING APPROACH

### Problem Resolution Process
1. **Issue Identification**: Clearly define what's wrong
2. **Environment Check**: Verify development environment
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate underlying causes
4. **Solution Development**: Create step-by-step resolution
5. **Implementation**: Execute with verification
6. **Documentation**: Record problem and solution
7. **Prevention**: Implement measures to avoid recurrence

### Common Scenarios

#### File System Operations
```python
# Always check file existence
if os.path.exists(file_path):
    # Perform operation
    result = perform_operation(file_path)
    # Verify result
    if verify_result(result):
        log_success(f"Operation successful: {file_path}")
    else:
        log_error(f"Operation failed: {file_path}")
else:
    log_error(f"File not found: {file_path}")
```

#### PyCharm Terminal Operations
```bash
# Always verify commands work
command_result=$(python --version 2>&1)
if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
    echo "Python available: $command_result"
else
    echo "Python not available"
fi
```
