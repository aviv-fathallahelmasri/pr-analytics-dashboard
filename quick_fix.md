# Quick Git Fix Steps

You have unstaged changes that need to be handled. Run these commands:

## 1. Check what files have unstaged changes:
```bash
git status
```

## 2. If the changes are in the deployment folder (which we don't want to track), just proceed with:
```bash
git pull origin main --no-rebase
```

## 3. Or if you want to stash the changes temporarily:
```bash
git stash
git pull origin main
git stash pop
```

## 4. After pulling, push your changes:
```bash
git push origin main
```

The `--no-rebase` flag will do a merge instead of rebase, which should work with your current state.
