# Fix Git Issues and Deploy

## Current Status:
- ✅ Tests passed - all 5/5 test suites successful
- ✅ Local changes committed
- ❌ Push rejected - remote has changes
- ⚠️ Deployment folder added as submodule

## Steps to fix:

### 1. First, let's remove the deployment folder from git tracking:
```bash
git rm --cached -r deployment
```

### 2. Add deployment to .gitignore:
```bash
echo "deployment/" >> .gitignore
```

### 3. Pull the latest changes from remote:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 4. If there are merge conflicts, resolve them (likely in index.html)

### 5. Add the .gitignore change:
```bash
git add .gitignore
```

### 6. Commit the fix:
```bash
git commit -m "fix: remove deployment submodule and add to gitignore"
```

### 7. Push everything:
```bash
git push origin main
```

## Alternative if pull has conflicts:

If the pull shows conflicts in index.html, you can force your version since you have the latest:

```bash
# Stash your changes
git stash

# Pull remote changes
git pull origin main

# Apply your changes on top
git stash pop

# If conflicts, keep your version
git checkout --ours index.html
git add index.html

# Continue with push
git push origin main
```
